Salary Predictions of Data Professions
Project Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Internship, focused on predicting the salaries of data professionals. In this project, you will dive into the world of regression tasks and gain hands-on experience in data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The goal is to predict the salaries of data professionals based on a rich dataset.

Problem Statement
Salaries in the field of data professions vary widely based on factors such as experience, job role, and performance. Accurately predicting salaries for data professionals is essential for both job seekers and employers.

Mission
Your mission in this internship is to build a predictive model for salaries of data professionals by following these key steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct comprehensive EDA, including data visualization, summary statistics, and identifying patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering
Create new features or transform existing ones that can provide additional insights or improve model performance.
Data Preprocessing
Prepare the data for model training by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features.
Machine Learning Model Development
Train various machine learning regression models to predict salaries, experimenting with different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation
Assess the performance of your models using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
ML Pipelines and Model Deployment
Create ML Pipelines to streamline the end-to-end machine learning process and deploy a model that can generate predictions for unseen data using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
Recommendations
Provide actionable recommendations based on your findings and insights from the model.
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

FIRST NAME: First name
LAST NAME: Last name
SEX: Gender
DOJ: Date of joining the company
CURRENT DATE: Current date of data
DESIGNATION: Job role/designation
AGE: Age
SALARY: Target variable, the salary of the data professional
UNIT: Business unit or department
LEAVES USED: Number of leaves used
LEAVES REMAINING: Number of leaves remaining
RATINGS: Ratings or performance ratings
PAST EXP: Past work experience
Conclusion
This internship offers an exciting opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to predict salaries in the data profession domain. By the end of the internship, you will have gained valuable skills in data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, regression model development, ML Pipelines, model deployment, and recommendation generation. Your work will provide valuable insights for job seekers and employers in the field of data professions.
